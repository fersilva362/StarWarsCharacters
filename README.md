# StarWarsCharacters
In this project, I used React to develop an App that fetch an API (https://swapi.dev/) to get the data of 82 characters in a json file format. Json file has several pages that I can access to the information trough a next/previous page. In addition, the items can be sorted alphabtically using a SELECT button (ascending or descending sort) and features (height,birth date) of each character can be accessed by clicking on it. The selected item changes to blue color (denote favourite character) that can be turned to its original color (black) by clicking again.
